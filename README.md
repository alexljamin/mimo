Handy Webpack 4 starter kit

## Get up and running on macOS

1. Install [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
2. Install latest Node.js:  
   `nvm install node`
3. Install all dependencies:  
   `npm i`
4. Run Webpack:  
   `npm run dev`

## What's new in 1.0.1?

- Farewell to [html-webpack-inline-svg-plugin](https://github.com/theGC/html-webpack-inline-svg-plugin)
- Warm welcome to [svg-sprite-loader](https://github.com/JetBrains/svg-sprite-loader) and [terser-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin)
- Cache busting for CSS and JS output

## Amaze me with features

- Easily use jQuery and Bootstrap in the build
- Neatly organise favicons, local fonts and php files to the desired folders
- Do most of the cool stuff to your fancy SCSS
- Run Webpack server with live reload

## Stuff to figure out

- Critical CSS
- HMR does not work with Live reload
- Conditional split into multi environment build (ex. dev and prod)
